                </figure>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Working at Paidia Studios was one of my first positions on campus.</p>
                <p class="main-paragraph"><strong>Initially, I had applied for an office assistant position.</strong> I wanted to lay low for my first semester of college and have a simple "come to work, check in, do my job, check out, and leave for the day" kind of job. But <strong>when Celia Pearce, a game design professor at Northeastern, reached out to me</strong> about my application saying she had two different positions available-- one of which would require more commitment and, of course, more of an interest in game development-- <strong>I was intrigued.</strong></p>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Most of my work in the beginning had to do with research. The storyline for the game we were developing at the time needed to be backed by facts, since it was a <strong>historical augmented reality game</strong>. While the interactions were a programmed illusion, the story and content we provided were all, for the most part, true. <strong>Over time, my responsibilities grew.</strong> I created <strong>a submission trailer</strong> for the game that was to be presented for a convention. I also <strong>worked on maintaining the Paidia Studios website</strong>: specifically updating assets and specific content.</p>
                <p class="main-paragraph">During my time there, one of my colleagues, Kevin Cannon-- who did a majority of graphics and artwork for Paidia and was overall a huge asset to the team-- designed tarot cards for several members of the team. The Strength tarot card, which I am depicted as being, is meant to represent courage, confidence, passion, energy, and vitality.</p>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Once our game, Who Is R. Mutt? reached the implementation stage, <strong>I was asked to work on the website portion of the game</strong> that the users interact with in order to advance in the storyline.</p>
                <p class="main-paragraph">While working for Paidia Studios, <strong>I gained skills I wouldn't have normally</strong> in my classes at Northeastern. I developed <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> experience as well as <strong>some exposure to cPanel</strong> and further use of <strong>Adobe Premiere Pro, InDesign</strong>, and Illustrator. Without this opportunity, I certainly wouldn't have gotten to where I am today, and for that <strong>I am so grateful</strong>.</p>

            <h2 id="mfa" class="secondary-header">Librarian's Assistant</h2>
            <h3>MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS — BOSTON, MA — MAY 2017 - DECEMBER 2017</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">During the summer after my freshman year, I participated in Northeastern's summer summer semester - <a href="https://undergraduate.northeastern.edu/nuterm/" target="_blank">NUTerm</a>. I had plans to attend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KEWWk-4vxU&ab_channel=AnisaAnuar" target="_blank">an art dialogue in Ireland</a> during the second half of the summer semester, and each student was entirely responsible for their own materials. Art supplies were expensive during the school year alone, so <strong>I decided to pick up another work-study so I could comfortably afford the materials</strong> (and enjoy my time in Ireland, of course).</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Finding a temporary job on such short notice was challenging, especially since I still had to work around my class schedule and existing job. <strong>When I came across the job posting for the MFA library, everything started to piece together.</strong> The position was flexible, and I was only expected to come in as often as my schedule allowed. On the days I came into the library for work, I would have classes in the morning, eat a quick meal, walk over to the library, and spend a couple of hours surrounded by endless shelves of books on art and history.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">The library offered limited access to MFA employees and researchers, which meant that few people dropped by, especially during my shifts, which were towards closing time. Those who did come by the library always had interesting requests on books to check out - <strong>each person looking for a different familiar artist or period in art history.</strong></p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">One of the defining aspects of my experience working at the library was definitely my manager, Paul, who always had me working on a new task. My days never felt repetitive or tiresome, as <strong>I was always learning or trying something new,</strong> whether it was restoring labels on books with fragile spines or transporting books from the library to the museum. The head librarian, Hee Jung, helped guide me whenever Paul was out, and her energy and compassion always boosted my spirits.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Even on the days when I did more "menial" tasks, like re-shelving books that were returned, <strong>I found ways to make the process more rewarding and satisfying.</strong> I would see how efficiently I could re-shelve them or if I could make a single route around the library, without having to cross paths over to somewhere I'd already been. I would find myself getting excited for the "big" books that got returned, because it meant using the rolling shelves and finding myself down a row I'd never seen before.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">I could imagine a role like that not being for everyone. But compared to the fast-paced, high-energy environment of working on a small game design team, the library was a welcome refresh. <strong>I enjoyed every moment of it</strong> and <strong>would be pleased to find myself working in a library once again in the future.</strong></p>

            <h2 id="khoury" class="secondary-header">Administrative Office Assistant</h2>
            <h3>NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY KHOURY COLLEGE OF COMPUTER SCIENCES — BOSTON, MA — SEPTEMBER 2017 - DECEMBER 2018</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">In an effort to make the most out of my freshman year of college, I spent my first summer taking extra classes, attending an art dialogue in Ireland, and taking on a second work-study on top of my year-round job. After all of this, I visited Malaysia for the first time since I was a baby. I'd had a busy year, and when I came back to campus, <strong>I found myself struggling again to afford class materials</strong> or to spend time with friends doing anything that would cost money. This semester, <strong>I ended up taking a third job</strong> <em>on top of</em> the game design team and the MFA library position. My friend recommended that I work at the advising office for our College, as it was relatively low commitment and flexible - exactly what I needed.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">During my time working in the Khoury advising office, I ended up assisting faculty with <strong>organizing student programs or preparing for lectures that I had attended less than a year prior.</strong> I was able to take a look behind the scenes at what planning these events and seminars looked like, and played a part in ensuring they went smoothly.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph"><strong>The biggest challenge of this position for me</strong> were the days when my manager Elizabeth was out, leaving the main reception desk as my responsibility. This meant taking calls and redirecting people to the correct person, greeting visitors and confirming appointments. Before college, I was incredibly shy and soft-spoken, and even after a year of being at Northeastern, I still had a hard time coming out of my shell. <strong>Customer service was a job that I was relatively unfamiliar with,</strong> as all my roles prior involved minimal interaction outside of my direct team. Working at the advising office forced me to assume the receptionist role and sit up straight, smile, and know exactly what to say at all times. It definitely required a <em>lot</em> of practice, but <strong>eventually I got the hang of it!</strong></p>

            <h2 id="makerspace" class="secondary-header">Laser Cutter Monitor</h2>
            <h3>NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY MAKERSPACE — BOSTON, MA — OCTOBER 2018 - DECEMBER 2018</h3>
                <figure class="post"><img src="./assets/lasercut.JPG" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    <figcaption>Some of the trinkets I was able to laser cut from leftover scrap from student projects</figcaption>
                </figure>
            <p class="main-paragraph">In June of 2018, I had just finished <a href="./nokia.html">my first co-op</a> at Nokia Technologies. It was my first time working without the added responsibility of classes. I also had decided to move off-campus into more affordable housing. At this point, <strong>I was reaching better financial stability</strong> than my first and second year. However, I still didn't feel comfortable <em>not</em> working - like <strong>it was irresponsible of me to rely entirely on the money I had made during co-op</strong> (which wasn't all too much, considering a lot of it went towards the apartment deposits).</p>
            <p>I had been working at Paidia Studios for a while at this point- even part-time during my first co-op for consulting. <strong>I decided it was time for a change of pace</strong> and to try something new. In the Fall of 2018, I picked up two new part-time jobs, including monitoring the laser cutter at Northeastern's Makerspace.</p>
            <p>This work-study was probably <strong>the most fun and the least demanding</strong>. I had never used a laser cutter before and I found the machine to be intriguing and beautiful. I was able to learn about the software within one short training session, and handled student requests relatively easily. The space was hardly ever busy with more than a couple of students at a time except for during midterm or final projects. When the space was emptier, <strong>I would use the scraps leftover from student projects to make little trinkets as gifts for my friends</strong> (personalized to their interests, of course). Once the space got busy, I focused on taking student requests and got a close look at what the 3D art class projects were like.</p>

            <h2 id="haynes" class="secondary-header">Early Education STEM Program Teacher</h2>
            <h3>HAYNES EARLY EDUCATION CENTER — ROXBURY CROSSING, MA — SEPTEMBER 2018 - DECEMBER 2018</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Design a curriculum for first graders to learn STEM topics through use of Sphero robots (e.g. drawing shapes with robot movements, navigating mazes made from recycled materials)</p>

            <h2 id="theEnd" class="secondary-header">The End of an Era</h2>
            <h3>"ALL GOOD THINGS MUST COME TO AN END"</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph"><strong>Fall 2018 was my last semester taking on part-time jobs</strong> - for several reasons. The most significant factor in me being able to give up my part-time work was <a href="./intuit.html">my second co-op</a> at Intuit. Since they provided housing, transportation, and a steep wage, <strong>I managed to save up a lot and didn't have to worry about money the next semester.</strong> I also found that my work was taking away from my education - <strong>I often struggled to make time for my classes because I was working</strong>. On the off weeks, I would be able to get work done for my classes at a lot of my part-time jobs when student requests were low, but the busy weeks for my jobs aligned with the busy weeks for my classes. The workload quickly became overwhelming, and <strong>there came a point where I had to drop one of my courses</strong> in order to handle all of my commitments.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">The best decision for me here was to take a semester off from working so I could focus entirely on classes and professional development. <strong>I worked on redesigning my portfolio and put much more time into my class projects.</strong> I always look back and wish I could've spent maybe one more semester working at the library or the laser cutter monitor or with the first grade students, but I don't regret a single decision I made. <strong>I loved every experience, but despite it all, the end had to come eventually.</strong> After all of this, I have so many stories to tell from each "work-study era" and I find myself with more talents than I would've expected to be leaving college with. And what more could I really ask for?</p>
