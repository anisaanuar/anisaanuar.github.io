                    <p class="main-paragraph">When I first came to Boston, I was beyond excited for the MBTA. Back home in Connecticut, the closest form of public transportation were the buses, and it would take me 30-45 minutes to get to the city from my house (which was realistically only 10-15 minutes away by driving). Often, you'd get somewhere faster by walking than trying to take public transportation to get there.
                    </p>
                    <p class="main-pargraph">So naturally, when I started using the MBTA, I found myself to be quite overwhelmed by the system. Unlike the buses in Connecticut, the T didn't have regular times or schedules posted - instead, you had to get to the station to see when the next bus or subway would arrive. At the time, a few apps had existed, but none were all that great. Nowadays, these apps have improved significantly - but I wanted to try my own hand at redesigning one of the apps that was permanently seared into my brain by its poor UI decisions.</p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">This presentation goes through the design process I followed, from benchmarking bad apps and a good app to creating UI and VD specs for the redesign. By the end of the process, I was so pleased with what I had. I have some notes on how to improve the experience and interface, but for only a few weeks to put the app together, I thought it turned out so well! It accomplished the goal I had of creating a more pleasant and relaxing UI - compared to the intense, stressful interface of the "bad" apps I benchmarked.</p>
