            <p><strong>Well, hello there!</strong> I'm still working on putting together individual project pages for each of these. You'll notice some pages with a star (<span class="star">&#9733;</span>) next to the title - those have active links and more information provided if you just click on them. For the others, I only currently have these previews and short descriptions available for you, but if you'd like any more info on a specific project, just check back in a few days or <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a>!</p>

                                        <p>Rock climbing is one of my favorite pastimes, and I love introducing new people to the sport. This infographic shows the basics of climbing, from the holds to the harnesses to the shoes. I enjoyed this experiment of making information something accessible, unique, and visually pleasing, and testing my abilities as an artist!</p>

                                    <p>I've learned that team spirit often comes from having unity. Apparel for large groups can bring people together in a way that few other things can, whether it be taking a large group photo with everyone wearing the same shirt, or showing up to a random event and seeing someone else wearing the same hoodie. It's that sense of "we're in this together" that I loved designing for.</p>

                                    <p>The Asian American community at Northeastern hosts quite a few events, and it's given me a lot of experience in creating promotional graphics. I've made promo materials for a fundraiser, a virtual conference, an in-person conference, and for workshops! Each project is completely different, and as you'll see, the graphics I make for them are as well.</p>

This can look like creating digital paintings of my friends stylized as a Pokemon trainer holding their favorite Pokemon in their arms or drawing a cute Shiba Inu!</p>
