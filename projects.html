            <p><strong>Well, hello there!</strong> I'm still working on putting together individual project pages for each of these. You'll notice some pages with a star (<span class="star">&#9733;</span>) next to the title - those have active links and more information provided if you just click on them. For the others, I only currently have these previews and short descriptions available for you, but if you'd like any more info on a specific project, just check back in a few days or <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a>!</p>

                                    <p>I've learned that team spirit often comes from having unity. Apparel for large groups can bring people together in a way that few other things can, whether it be taking a large group photo with everyone wearing the same shirt, or showing up to a random event and seeing someone else wearing the same hoodie. It's that sense of "we're in this together" that I loved designing for.</p>
