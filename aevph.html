                    <p class="main-paragraph">For my 22nd birthday, I wanted to do something that channeled every aspect of my identity. It was my first birthday in quarantine, and I had to work with my virtual limits. Very few virtual escape rooms had existed that early on (July 2020), and I wanted something that as many of my friends could enjoy as possible. A couple of weeks later, AEVPH was born!
                    </p>
                    <p class="main-pargraph">I had quite a bit of experience in creating a website from just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and working quickly (as long as it's something I'm passionate about) is my strength. It only took me two weeks to get AEVPH up and running in time for people to play through it - including all the assets and graphics. Each puzzle had a special attachment to my identity, whether it be my favorite game (crossword puzzles) or set in my favorite place (Dunkin' Donuts).</p>

            <p class="main-paragraph">Below are some of my favorite screens! As I mentioned, almost all of the graphics were made by myself. However, I did use a few code templates for some of the games, like the crossword or word searches, that are credited within <a href="https://github.com/anisaanuar/anisaanuar.github.io/tree/master/aevph" target="_blank">my code</a>.</p>

            <h2>Speed run!!!</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">In case you were wondering, my virtual birthday party went super well! I hosted two different days for people to come and play through, made a few changes after the first day, and had a few one-on-one sessions with others who couldn't make it afterwards for more testing. The day of the event, my friends actually posted a speed-run of the hunt! I wanted to see how quickly I could do as the creator of the hunt, so I made a video as well! (Fair warning, you'll see me get a little bit intense, as I do have some competitive spirit and wanted to beat their time.) Also, <strong>I recommend you try the puzzle yourself before watching this video!</strong></p>
